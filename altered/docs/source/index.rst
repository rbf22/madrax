=================================

Madrax is a force field implemented as a differentiable PyTorch module and capable of estimate the energies that stabilize protein folding. This module can be used in the same way of a pytorch layer, which take as input a protein structure and return a tensor containing the Gibbs energies. The library is deep learining-ready
